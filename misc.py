        moves (diagonal left, straight down, diagonal right) to find optimal path.
        
        Algorithm steps:
        1. Pads the error matrix with infinity values to handle edge cases
        2. Builds cumulative error matrix from top to bottom
        3. Tracks optimal moves using a paths matrix
        4. Reconstructs optimal path from bottom to top
        
        Compared to Dijkstra-based minCutPath():
        + Faster due to vectorized NumPy operations
        + More memory efficient for grid graphs
