Simply takes random patches from the input texture and places them side by side

Results in the most basic and usually lowest quality synthesis
Used for the first patch in all modes and throughout if "random" is selected


"best" mode:

Uses randomBestPatch() to find patches that match well with existing neighbors
For each new patch position, it:

Scans the entire input texture
Computes the L2 difference between the overlapping regions
Chooses the patch with the minimum error


Better than random but can still show visible seams between patches


"cut" mode (default):

Most sophisticated mode, implementing the full Efros-Freeman algorithm
First finds the best matching patch like "best" mode
Then uses minCutPatch() to compute an optimal boundary between the new patch and existing content
The optimal boundary is found using Dijkstra's algorithm to find the minimum cost path through the error surface
Results in the most seamless transitions between patches
